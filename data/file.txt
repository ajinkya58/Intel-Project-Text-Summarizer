Tom went to the park in the morning. He carried a blue bag with him. In the bag, he had a red ball, a sandwich, and a bottle of water. Tom saw three birds sitting on a tree. He also saw a dog running near the swings. After a while, Tom sat on a bench to eat his sandwich. A boy named Sam came to the park with his yellow kite. Tom and Sam played with the red ball. Later, they flew the kite together. When it got windy, Tom decided to go home. He picked up his blue bag and left the park.

As Tom walked home, he noticed a small kitten by the side of the road. The kitten was white with black spots and looked hungry. Tom knelt down and gently petted the kitten. He decided to give it a small piece of the sandwich he had saved. The kitten happily ate the food and started following Tom. He laughed and thought maybe it wanted to come home with him.

When Tom reached his house, his little sister, Emma, was waiting outside. She was excited to see the kitten. "Can we keep it?" Emma asked eagerly. Tom wasn’t sure. "We’ll have to ask Mom," he replied.

Inside, their mother was cooking lunch. Tom and Emma told her about the kitten. Mom smiled and said, "If the kitten doesn’t belong to anyone, we can take care of it." Emma quickly filled a small bowl with milk, and the kitten drank it all up. They decided to name the kitten Spot, because of its black spots.

That afternoon, Tom, Emma, and Spot went to the backyard to play. Emma brought out her toy car and Tom brought the red ball again. They tried rolling the ball for Spot to chase, but Spot was more interested in napping under a shady tree. As they played, their neighbor, Mrs. Green, walked by with her big brown dog, Max. Max barked at Spot, but the kitten didn’t seem scared. In fact, Spot stood still and watched Max with curious eyes.

Later that evening, their dad came home from work. He was surprised to see the kitten, but after hearing the story, he agreed to keep Spot for the night. Before bed, Tom and Emma made a small bed for Spot out of an old blanket and a box. The kitten curled up and fell asleep quickly.

The next day, Tom and Emma decided to make posters to see if anyone had lost a kitten. They wrote, "Found: White kitten with black spots" and added their phone number. They posted the flyers around the neighborhood, near the park, and in the grocery store.

Days passed, but no one called about the kitten. Spot seemed happy in its new home. Tom and Emma played with Spot every day after school. One day, while they were in the park, Sam joined them again. He brought his kite and asked Tom if he wanted to fly it. While they flew the kite, Spot chased the shadows on the ground.

A few weeks later, something unexpected happened. One afternoon, an old man named Mr. Harris knocked on their door. He held one of the posters they had put up. "I believe you found my kitten," he said with a kind smile. Tom and Emma looked at each other, unsure of what to say.

Mr. Harris explained that Spot had wandered off one day, and he had been looking for it ever since. "I miss my little friend," he said softly. Tom and Emma knew they had grown attached to Spot, but they realized the kitten had an owner who loved it just as much. After some thought, they decided to give Spot back to Mr. Harris.

Mr. Harris was grateful and promised that Tom and Emma could visit Spot anytime. As a thank-you, he brought them a batch of homemade cookies the next day. Though they missed Spot, Tom and Emma felt happy knowing they had done the right thing.

The story of Spot brought Tom and Sam closer as friends, and they continued playing together in the park. And even though Spot was no longer with them, they still had the fun memories of their time with the little kitten.
